# LucasMogg-Cardio-Challenge-4.1
# Main Project Overview

This project involves parameter optimization by analyzing CSV files containg photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to align calculated data with expected outcomes.

## Installation

To set up this project:
  Install required Python libraries via pip (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, numpy).

## Usage

Follow these steps to utilize this project:
1. Define the directory containing the CSV files.
2. Exclude any unwanted CSV files by listing them.
3. Specify paths for files that need data inversion.
4. Input your expected data.
5. Convert this data into a DataFrame for analysis.
6. Set a folder path for saving output plots.
7. Execute main script to process the data.
8. Use provided functions to compare calculated results with expected metrics.
9. Perform parameter optimization using grid search to find parameters that minimise errors.
